# Get into Teaching Asset Manager

## Introduction
Contributors to the Department of Education's (DfE) "Get into Teaching" system need to be able to upload various files such as images and calendar files, so they can be used in email campaigns.

These email campaigns will involve sending messages to thousands of users, who will want to see any images and invitations. Therefore a Content Delivery Network (CDN) is required to handle the traffic.

Contributors can be external partners with the DfE and therefore will need to have access to upload these files. So Google Drive has been selected. 

Within 10 minutes of a file being uploaded it will be available as a URL on the domain [https://assets-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/](https://assets-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/)

## Usage

## Support
To gain access to Google Drive you will need to be given access by the [Digital Tools Support](https://sites.google.com/digital.education.gov.uk/digitaltools/home) team.

Users without a @digital.education email address will need to request access via their DfE contacts. alternately they can email [Digital Tools Support](mailto:digital-tools-support@digital.education.gov.uk)
