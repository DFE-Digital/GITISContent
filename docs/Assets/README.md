# How to Use

## Connecting

The Get Into Teaching Asset manager uses [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive) as a front end.

This allows contributors to upload new files from any location, as long as they have been given access to the [GITISContent Shared Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AJ6YEVtSfOQVUk9PVA)

## Contributors

### Access
When requesting access you should add a message, informing the [Digital Tools Support](https://sites.google.com/digital.education.gov.uk/digitaltools/home) that you will need to have [Contributor](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7337554?hl=en) access


## Delivery

### Mapping
Within the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive) there are sub-directories, these will map to the domain [https://assets-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/](https://assets-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/).

For example a directory in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive) called DMimages will resolve to [https://assets-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/DMimages](https://assets-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/DMimages)

Therefore a file in that directory will map to the same file name, so for example the file in DMimages with the name logo-teaching_yellow.png will be available as [https://assets-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/DMimages/logo-teaching_yellow.png](https://assets-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/DMimages/logo-teaching_yellow.png)

### Schedule

The process to map a file is scheduled to run every 10 minutes.
