# How to Use


## Connecting

The Get Into Teaching Asset manager uses [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive) as a front end.

This allows contributors to upload new files from any location, as long as they have been given access to the [GITISContent Shared Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AJ6YEVtSfOQVUk9PVA)

## Contributors

Files added will appear in the production environment within minutes, so only files that have been approved by the events team or the marketing team stakeholders must be added to the google drive folders.

The following 3 folders have been set up and should only have the correct type of files placed into each:

* **DMimages** is for marketing images used within emails sent from Microsoft dynamics - so the mailing list , campaign or events emails. 

* **Appointments** is only for .ics or calendar appointment files and the filename must include the event webfeed id. 

* **EventImages** is only currently for images of the buildings that DfE events are taking place at - these images will be embedded into event pages on the website.

Files should be overwritten with/by new versions. Access should be restricted to uses to prevent deleteing anything.

If a delete is needed then the contributor must get approval from the CRM devs and stakeholders first - even after a campaign has finished.

### Access
When requesting access you should add a message, informing the [Digital Tools Support](https://sites.google.com/digital.education.gov.uk/digitaltools/home) that you will need to have [Contributor](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7337554?hl=en) access

Access to the role [Content Manager](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7337554?hl=en), should be restricted to those authorised by the stakeholders.

## Delivery

### Mapping
Within the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive) there are sub-directories, these will map to the domain [https://assets-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/](https://assets-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/).

For example a directory in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive) called DMimages will resolve to [https://assets-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/DMimages](https://assets-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/DMimages)

Therefore a file in that directory will map to the same file name, so for example the file in DMimages with the name logo-teaching_yellow.png will be available as [https://assets-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/DMimages/logo-teaching_yellow.png](https://assets-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/DMimages/logo-teaching_yellow.png)

### Schedule

The process to map a file is scheduled to run every 10 minutes.
